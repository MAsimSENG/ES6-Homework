/*

when var is used inside a function it has scope of the entire function.
When it is used outside of the function it acts as a global variable.

When 'let' is used to define a variable it limits its scope to be inside of
the block that its in.

Const: also limited to block scope. However its value can not be reassinged.
       a const is however mutable.

*/

function hello(){
  // var scopes the entire function
  var hi = "using var to say hi";
  // let limits scope to if block
  if(1==1){
    let hello = "holla";
  }
  // const has block level scope, in this case it is the entire function
  // can't reassign const but can still change the value
  const HELLO = "hello"

  HELLO +=" HI"


}
